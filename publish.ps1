#  Foos — publish a new release
#
#  Usage:
#     .\publish.ps1                       (prompts for version + notes)
#     .\publish.ps1 -Version 0.1.1 -Notes "Pull-to-refresh polish"
#
#  What it does:
#     1. Bumps the version in pubspec.yaml (and the build number)
#     2. Commits the change
#     3. Creates a v<version> tag with your release notes
#     4. Pushes — which triggers GitHub Actions to build the signed APK
#        and publish it as a Release your phone can pull (long-press top edge
#        → the update sheet, or the banner on next launch).
